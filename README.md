# Jenkins CI Build Monitor Plugin

Provides a highly visible, subtly animated view of current project status.
Ideal as an Extreme Feedback Device to be displayed on a screen on your office wall.

## Setting up

To create a new Build Monitor View, click on the "New View" tab, select "Build Monitor View" and select jobs you wish
to display on the monitor. You can have as many Build Monitor Views as you want - the most popular approach is to have one per team
or one per project.

## Known Limitations

### Browser support - Google Chrome and Opera only.

To avoid unnecessary complexity when implementing the view layer I decided to use CSS 3 flexbox.
Regretfully, the standard is only [properly supported](http://caniuse.com/flexbox) by the
[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) and [Opera](http://www.opera.com/download/â€Ž).

What this means to you is that if you'd like to use the Build Monitor plugin, please make sure
that you're using Chrome or Opera to display it. Safari 7 and Internet Explorer 11 will be supporting this functionality
in the [near future](http://caniuse.com/flexbox).

### View configuration stored in a session cookie

Current implementation of Angular.js doesn't seem to allow for storing cookies with expiry time set to
[anything longer than "session"](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12624181/angularjs-how-to-set-expiration-date-for-cookie-in-angularjs).

What this means to you is that if you change the default font size or column count settings and restart the browser,
you'll need to apply your changes again after restart. I'm working on this one, so stay tuned.

## Roadmap

1. Display what triggered the build (SCM change, another job, manual)
2. Display how long has a given job been failing for
3. Support for [Claim Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Claim+plugin)
4. Support for [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com)
5. Display parameters of parametrized jobs
6. Persist layout configuration changes in a long-lived cookie.
